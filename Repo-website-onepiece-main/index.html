						As a child, Monkey D. Luffy was inspired to become a pirate by listening to the tales of the buccaneer "Red-Haired" Shanks. But Luffy's life changed when he accidentally ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit and gained the power to stretch like rubber...at the cost of never being able to swim again! Years later, still vowing to become the king of the pirates, Luffy sets out on his adventure...one guy alone in a rowboat, in search of the legendary "One Piece," said to be the greatest treasure in the world...

						Follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his pirate crew in order to find the greatest treasure ever left by the legendary Pirate, Gold Roger. The famous mystery treasure named "One Piece".
						Monkey. D. Luffy refuses to let anyone or anything stand in the way of his quest to become the king of all pirates. 
						With a course charted for the treacherous waters of the Grand Line and beyond, this is one captain who'll never give 
						up until he's claimed the greatest treasure on Earth: the Legendary One Piece!
						The twentieth season of the One Piece anime series was produced by Toei Animation, directed by Tatsuya Nagamine and Satoshi Ito. 
						The season began broadcasting in Japan on Fuji Television on July 7, 2019.
						One Piece is a Japanese animated television series based on the successful manga and currently has 1,054 episodes.
						<br><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRMG8ZQZR/one-piece">Episodes Link</a>
					</p></li>
					<li><p align="justify">
						One Piece has become a worldwide phenomenon among anime enthusiasts. The anime has already established itself as one of the greatest ever created. 
						And because of its monumental success, several 
						One Piece movies have been released to expand on existing plotlines or set the stage for new adventures for the Straw Hat Pirates.<br>
						While almost all One Piece movies are non-canon, they have manga-canon moments from time to time. 
						With over 1,000 episodes and 15 movies under its belt, it can certainly be confusing for new One Piece fans to follow the right order. 
						<br>Since the premiere of the anime adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's One Piece manga in 1999, Toei Animation has produced 15 feature films
						based on the franchise traditionally released during the Japanese school spring break since 2000.
